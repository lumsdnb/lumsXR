# lums.io in 3D

This is a work in progress, the goal is to make my projects available as a 3D experience. I might switch to React Three Fiber depending on how it goes with Threlte.

## Developing

Install required dependencies and run dev server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
